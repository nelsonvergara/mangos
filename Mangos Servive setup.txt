Set up Mangos as Windows Service:

In order to set up mangos to run as service (windows), all you have to do is just :

1. Open Command Prompt

2. Change directory to where mangosd.exe and realmd.exe can be found (for example C:\ReaperMangos5472) by typing :

cd C:\ReaperMangos5472

or

cd /d C:\ReaperMangos5472

3. and then to install the realmd.exe and mangosd.exe as service, you need to type these:

mangosd.exe -s install
realmd.exe -s install

to install it as windows service … or type …

mangosd.exe -s uninstall
realmd.exe -s uninstall

to uninstall / remove it from windows service

OR if you prefer a more direct way of doing it … you can type:

C:\ReaperMangos5472\mangosd.exe -s install / -s uninstall

directly without changing directory first
